(Fairly) Robuse file downloader written in Python. First attempt at TDD so the script looks to be structured differently than what one would write for a simple file downloader.

USAGE:

Run the script as a module (python -m RobustDownloader x y) where x and y are the strings of the url and filename respectively.
